this does not currently work because I do not understand midi. its just a pet project that turned into
a learning exercise in reading files byte by byte. if you want a functioning program, go check out
https://github.com/yobson1/webfishing-midi.git

also it will only play anything on 1600x900 resolution because I havent figured that part out yet either
